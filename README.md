# Birthday-App
This is my first test driven web application that was built after an introduction to Ruby, Sinatra and Capybara. 
# How to use
* run "ruby app.rb" in ther terminal
* enter your birthday
* You will see how many days until your next birthday
* If your birthday is today, you will be wished Happy Birthday!
